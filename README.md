# What's here?

## Re-homed open source libraries

I'm providing a home for a number of open-source libraries from the [whiteoctober](https://github.com/whiteoctober) organisation, since that organisation is due to be deleted.

I'm not able to maintain these (apart from the most minor tweaks), but having them here at least means they won't disappear when the organisation is deleted. So they're either looking for maintainers or have a preferred fork. Where there's a preferred fork, I've archived the repo and linked to it prominently.

One or two re-homed repos aren't exactly libraries but are just nice things I didn't want to lose with the demise of the org.

## Tests, forks, etc

Repos for testing, forks of other repos so I can make Pull Requests; nothing to see here.

## Exercise repos

Various technical exercises I've worked through have repos here. Not the best place to look to ascertain my technical skills, since they're experimental by nature. Again, not particularly worth your time.

## Other things

That just leaves a handful:

- [dotfiles](https://github.com/sampart/dotfiles) - I like dotfiles; here are mine.
- [ruby-hard-skills](https://github.com/sampart/ruby-hard-skills) - an idea I had around getting Ruby basics into "muscle memory".
- [kashflow-python-samples](https://github.com/sampart/kashflow-python-samples) - super old now, so may be completely outdated.

And maybe some other things I've added in the meantime. But if they were really interesting, I'd probably have remembered to mention them here.

I have plenty of non-programming things to do in my free time, so my GitHub account isn't the best place to find evidence of my programming abilities - almost all of my professional work is on private repos elsewhere, sorry! You'll see little bits and bobs in others' public repos in the contributions section below, plus `x contributions in private repositories`, showing that I really do make contributions elsewhere, honest :wink:.

My website (see sidebar) is probably a good next step, if you're interested in seeing my technical writing and presenting.
